## What I learnt from the Project

I’ve gained practical knowledge in web development particularly HTML and CSS. The use of  version control, GIT and GITHUB has been very helpful, enlightening me on how to work witha team and also keep track of changes made at any point in time . I also learnt the importance of clear documentation and user-friendly interfaces. It's been a great journey so far.
